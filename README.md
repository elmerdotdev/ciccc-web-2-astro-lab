# Web 2 - Astro Lab Day

**Goal:** To learn how to use Astro Content Collections by building a content-based website.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `cd hilarious-horizon` to go inside the Astro project directory. Run `npm install` to install the node packages/dependencies required by Astro listed inside the `package.json` file.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the project.
4. Set up your project pages:

    - `home.astro`
    - `about.astro`
    - `projects/index.astro` - Projects listing page
    - `projects/[id].astro` - Individual project pages dynamic route
    - `blog/index.astro` - Blog listing page
    - `blog/[id].astro` - Individual article pages dynamic route

5. Create a directory called `data` inside the `/src` directory. Inside the data directory, create two directories for the content of your projects and blog. Make sure your content is in Markdown format:

    - `src/data/projects/project-1.md`
    - `src/data/projects/project-2.md`

    - `src/data/blog/my-first-article.md`
    - `src/data/blog/my-second-article.md`

    Feel free to add more projects or blog articles. Use dummy content and check out the Markdown guide [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/] to help you with the format. Also check out the Astro documentation on how to create the content [https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-custom-ids]

6. Add the properties to the top of your `.md` documents. Make sure the `id` is unique for every file. Keep it the same as the filename for now:

    **Example:**

    ```md
    ---
    title: My Awesome Project 1
    author: Elmer Balbin
    id: project-1 <!-- This will appear as http://localhost:4321/projects/project-1 -->
    ---

    # Markdown content
    ```

7. Create a `content.config.js` inside your `src/` directory. This file is needed to define your collections. Add your collection loaders into the file. Make sure you point them to their respective directories:

    ```js
    import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
    import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders';

    const blog = defineCollection({
      loader: glob({ pattern: "**/*.md", base: "./src/data/blog" })
    });

    export const collections = { blog };
    ```

8. Add content to all your pages using dummy content. For the **projects** and **blog** landing pages, output their collection titles with a *"Read More"* link for each one that points to their dynamic route. Reference: [https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#using-content-in-astro-templates]

9. The dynamic routes `[id].astro` should show the Markdown content. Reference: [https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#building-for-static-output-default]

10. Create a `Header.astro` and `Footer.astro` component. Add a menu to your header so that's easier to navigate your site.

11. Add some styling but don't spend too much time on this. Just make your website look clean... and responsive ü§®

12. Commit and push your changes once you are done.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

Sometimes when you create or add a new collection, you may have to restart your Astro project. You can do `Ctrl+C` to stop the project, and run `npm run dev` to start it up again.
